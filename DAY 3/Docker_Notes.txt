Docker

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications as containers.
* Consistent, isolated environments
* Fast development
* Supports agile, CI/CD practices
* Easy testing, collaboration, immutability

Container:
A standard unit of software that encapsulates everything needed to build, ship, and run applications.
Characteristics:
* Virtualizes the OS
* Lightweight
* Fast, isolated, secure, uses less memory
* Portability
* Lower deployment time

==========================================   
Important Docker Concepts: mage,Container,Volumes,Networking

Docker Image:
An executable snapshot artifact â€” an immutable template that includes source code, complete environment config.

Docker Container:
Running instance of an image. Can run multiple containers from same image.

---VM vs Docker---
VM : Mimics a full machine
Docker: Lightweight, shares kernel with host
Docker is written to run on Linux kernel
Docker image contains all things necessary for running the app
Hypervisor: software to create/manage VMs

===============================
To install Docker :
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh

While installing docker,we get a client as well as deamon(running background process).Windows has UI based tools but for linux it won't have,so these clients are embedded within the terminal in linux.     

COMMANDS
========
